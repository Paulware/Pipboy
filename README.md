Raspberry pi pipboy code

This repository contains mostly php code that runs on an apache web-server, running on the raspberry pi.

The pages that are served, display equally well on an android device, iPhone or laptop.

These pages allow a user logged-in as admin to start a game, add devices and move inventory between players.
