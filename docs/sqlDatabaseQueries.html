<h3>Commands</h3>
  <ul>

  <li>Once inside mysql, to Connect to the database, type the command: Connect Paulware</li>
  <li>To see the tables type the command: show tables;</li>
  <li>To see the data in a table type the command: select * from tablename;</li>
  <li>To see all the pipboys type the command: select * from pipboys;</li>
  <li>Fields in each table can be modified with the alter table sql command</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Queries</h3>
  Queries are used during the game to take action.  Learning the queries is a great way to understand 
  the basic design of the system.  The queries are executed inside of php files.  Common.inc is the php file which
  is used to connect to the database. 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Select * from pipboys</b><p>This is your basic query to read all the pipboy information that has been registered with the system.  Each row of data
  will contain the information:
    <table border="2px">
    <tr><td>ID</td><td>Primary Key, unique integer which identifies the row</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Typename</td><td>Type of device connected to the network</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAC</td><td>Machine Id of network chip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>IpAddress</td><td>Ip address of network chip assigned by router</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Health</td><td>Health of the Pipboy player</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Username</td><td>Name of the player</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Location</td><td>[Latitude,Longitude] of player (not currently used)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hits</td><td>Incremented when the player "hits" an enemy player.  Used to create a leaderboard.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Team</td><td>Color of the team that the player is on.  Set by the administrator</td></tr>
    </table>   
    <br>
    This query is called by index.php to show the table of pipboys.  It is also used by various functions in common.php
    to perform operations on the database.  One such operation is to increment the Hits field when the player 
    scores a hit.  This operation is performed by the common.php function named: incrementHits.
  </li><p>
  <li><b>Update pipboys Set Health=25</b> <br>
     This query is used at the start of capture the flags, to set the health of all 
     players to 25.  This query is called out of the captureTheFlag function located in common.php
  </li><p>
  <li><b>Reset flag colors to 'None'</b><br>
     This query is used at the start of capture the flags.<br>
     It is accomplished by doing 2 queries, the first query finds all the flags<br>
     The second query sets the flag color = 'None'<br>
     Here is the php code that does it:
     <pre>
     // Set Flag colors = None
     $sql = "Select * From pipboys Where Typename='Flag'";
     $result = query ($sql);
     while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc ($result)) {		
        $ID = $row["ID"]; // Primary key
        $sql = "Update pipboys set Team='None' Where ID=$ID";
        $q = query($sql);
     }     
     </pre>
     </li>
  
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  Other tables and their descriptions: <br>
  items: A table of items and their names<br>
  inventory: A table of itemid, ownerids and quantities
