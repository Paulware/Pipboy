<H1>HTML and javascript design</H1>
This is the standard format of 90% of the HTML pages.  It is created by each .php file.  Php files write
html by using the "echo" or "print" php command.
<pre>
&lthtml>
&lthead>
&lttitle>Title of Page</title>
&ltScript>
  function runQuery (Team,ID) {
    var sql = "Update pipboys Set Team='" + Team + "' Where ID=" + ID;
    window.location.href='query.php?sql=' + escape(sql);
  }
  &lt/Script>
&lt/head>

&ltbody>
&ltinput type="button" value="Run Query" onclick="runQuery ('Blue', 1);">
&lt/body>
&lt/html>
</pre>
<br>
Javascript functions at the top of the page are called after the buttons are pressed.  The javascript
functions perform the action that the user wants to perform.
<br>
In this example, by pressing the "Run Query" button, query.php is called and a sql database query is performed.
<p>
Note: query.php <b>automatically returns to the .php calling page</b> because it uses this javascript snippet: 
<pre>
&ltscript>
   <i>window.location.href = document.referrer;</i>
&lt/script>
</pre>
as the final operation of query.php.  This also refreshes the calling .php page (very handy!).<br>
<input type="button" value="Back" onclick="window.location.href='docs.html';">
