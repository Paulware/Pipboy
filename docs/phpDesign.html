Using a browser (like internet explorer or Google chrome), a user will command the apache web server 
(running on the raspberry pi) to serve .php files.<br>
PHP is executed when the user enters the url location of the php file.  For example, by entering<br>
<b>http://192.168.X.Y/Pipboy/index.php</b>  (where X.Y is assigned by the router).
<p>
PHP can also be executed when a network device calls in using its .lua code.  In this case it does 
not care about the .html page generated but rather wants to update the database or perform an action<p>
The apache web-server executes the .php files and creates an html page or updates the database.  HTML pages are 
created by using the php command "echo" or "print".  Database updates are accomplished using the php command 
"mysql_query".
<p>
Here is the list of .php files and a brief description.  Click on their link to view more detailed information.<br>
