Python is used to accomplish 2 things:
<ol>
<li><b>broadcastAddress.py</b> - Broadcast the raspberry pi's ip address<p>
This is accomplished by sending a udp broadcast message to all devices on the local subnet.
<p>
broadcastAddress.py is started when the raspberry pi boots up.  /etc/rc.local is the system file that 
is run on startup that starts broadcastAddress.py.
Every 30 seconds the message is sent on port 3333.
</li>
<li><b>sendMessage.py</b> - Send a message from the raspberry pi to a network device<br>

The IP Address of the receiving device must be known.  The IP Address is passed as a command parameter to this 
python file.  The php command "exec" is used to execute sendMessage.py.
Port 3333 is used to send/receive this message.
</li>
</ol>
